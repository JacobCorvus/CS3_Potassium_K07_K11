                <h2> An upcoming webseries by Tony Espiritu and Jacob Corpus</h2>
                <p> Artemis Sallow is an investigator for PATRON, an agency who acts 
                    as the world government after "Old Earth's" fall to a magical virus
                that now has the capability to give magic to those who can survive it.</p>
                <p>However, her faith in the agency and those in control begins to waver
                    as she discovers a conspiracy that threatens the lives of those she 
                    had sworn to protect.
