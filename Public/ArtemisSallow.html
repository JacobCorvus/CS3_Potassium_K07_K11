      <h2>INFO</h2>
      <p>Artemis Sallow is PATRON's youngest employee to have been promoted to Senior Investigator,
        and also one of its most skilled operatives. She was personally recommended by former Commander-in-Chief
        Polaris. Artemis has over a 100 solved cases under her belt, but is most likely going to be stuck at her
        position for the foreseeable future, considering the fact that she does not have any notable powers.

      <h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
      <p>Artemis was raised in the frontier settlement of Virellis Reach by a family of scouts. 
        They were poor, but dependable. At seventeen, 
        during a terror attack, Artemis and her family were caught in the crossfire.
        Their house and property were all destroyed, and the family plunged into deeper impoverishment
      which forced Apollo, her twin, to join the PATRON Agency as a sorcerer. 
      <br>
      <br>
      Soon, he would rise amongst his peers
    and pulled his family along with him. Artemis, born without the immunity needed to resist the deadly virus but gain
  its magic was disregarded and considered useless. Behind the scenes, her parents sold her off to a secret lab where she was experimented
on with different compounds. Later, she would be freed led by a taskforce of sorcerers led by her own brother, yet their relationship is still estranged.
Artemis soon joined the Agency herself.</p>
